### Local Development
`npm start` will run the project locally on **port 8080** and efficiently restart the node process when files are modified.

### Production Build
`npm run build` will compile typescript and build a production bundle at **/build/index.js**.

### Production Deploy
`npm run deploy` will clear cache, build a fresh production bundle, and run deploy scripts.
